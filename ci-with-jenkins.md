SDLC - Software development life cycle 

End User - Person who uses it 

Once product is ready - Run tests - If tests fail, add the functiuonality to the file , run tests again to make sure it passes

Have breakpoints set in the code so that if any errors, we can find them easily 

testing make our life eazier, we dont have to test every line of code 

when you deploy your code to production - this is called a release 

Devops makes software releases faster  

DevOps modernised the life cycle using automation tools

When you upload your code to your repo, automatic testing allows for rapid feedback - This is CI

Delivery is next from CI 

Continous Delivery is after intergration, that is not infront of the client 

Continuos Depoloyment is after the product has been given to the user
